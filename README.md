# ChatGPT_React_Summarizer
bash script for summarizing the ./src tree for js and css files. 

The resultant file output.txt can be pasted into ChatGPT in order to perform code analysis and enhancements with ChatGPT. 

This program creates a header for every js and css file in the ./src directory (and subdirectories).


USAGE:

From a bash prompt, run the script 'doit'. (./doit) from the base directory (../src). This will create the file output.txt, consisting of a tree summary and then the file contents. This can be copied and then pasted into a ChatGPT (or other AI) prompt, for code analysis and keeping development on the right track with the AI.
